# Betsy
An artificially intelligent knowledge accumulation assistant

## How Betsy is Developed
Betsy is developed in various Git branches, each in a different
programming language. They are as follows.

- master (Common Lisp)
- Java
- Python

The reason I chose to do this is because besides achieving the
specific design goals of the Betsy project, as a secondary goal,
I wanted to learn other languages too. I could not think of a
better way to do that than porting code from one language to
another.

Other beneficial side effects of doing this are discovering a
better way of writing already written code during the language
porting process (refactoring) and learning what language is
right for a given job. All valuable traits for one to possess.

Each branch is developed until they all reach a common design
goal and are stable to use. It is at this point that a common
stable release is made for each. Which branch one chooses to
install Betsy from is dependent on what is best for you.
