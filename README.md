# Betsy
An artificially intelligent knowledge accumulation assistant

## How Betsy is Developed
Betsy is developed in various Git branches, each in a different
programming language. They are as follows.

- master (Common Lisp)
- Java
- Python

The reason I chose to do this is because I wanted to learn other
languages. I could not think of a better way to do that than
porting code from one language to another.

There are other beneficial side effects, such as discovering a
better way of writing already written code during the language
porting process (refactoring) and learning what language is
right for a given job.

Each branch is developed until they all reach a common design
goal and are stable. It is at this point that a release is made
for each. Which branch one chooses to install from is dependent
on what is best for you.
