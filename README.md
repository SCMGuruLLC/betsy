# Betsy
An artificially intelligent knowledge accumulation assistant

## How Betsy is Developed
Betsy is developed in various Git branches, each in a different
programming language. They are as follows.

- master (Common Lisp)
- Java
- Python

The reason I chose to do this is because besides achieving the
specific design goals of the Betsy project, as a secondary goal,
I wanted to learn other languages too. I could not think of a
better way to do that than porting code from one language to
another.

Other beneficial side effects of doing this are discovering a
better way of writing already written code during the language
porting process, and when asked to develop for someone else,
know what language is right for the job. All valuable traits to
possess.
